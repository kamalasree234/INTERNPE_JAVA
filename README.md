 TASK 1:GUESS THE NUMBER GAME
 The Number Guessing Game is an interactive console-based Java application designed to challenge and entertain players by having them guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. This project combines simple yet effective gameplay mechanics with a user-friendly interface, providing an enjoyable experience for users of all ages.

Features:

Random Number Generation:

Each game session starts with the computer randomly selecting a number between 1 and 100. This ensures that every game is unique and challenging.
User Input and Feedback:

Players are prompted to guess the number, with their input being read from the console.
After each guess, the game provides feedback on whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct.
Attempts Tracking:

The game tracks the number of attempts the player makes to guess the correct number, adding an element of challenge and encouraging improvement in subsequent plays.
Proximity Hints:

If the player's guess is within 10 units of the target number, the game provides a hint indicating that the player is "very close." This feature helps to maintain player engagement and motivation.
Winning Message:

Upon correctly guessing the number, the game congratulates the player and displays the total number of attempts made.
Replay Option:

After the game ends, players are asked if they want to play again. If the player chooses to continue, a new game session starts; otherwise, the game ends with a farewell message.
Clean Exit:

The game ensures a clean and friendly exit, thanking the player for participating and closing the scanner resource properly.
Project Goals:

Enhance Programming Skills: This project aims to develop Java programming skills, particularly in using loops, conditionals, and random number generation.
User Interaction: It focuses on improving user interaction through real-time feedback and a smooth gaming experience.
Basic Game Development: It serves as an introduction to basic game development concepts, including game loops, input handling, and replayability.
How to Play:

Run the Java application.
Read the welcome message and instructions.
Guess the number by entering a value between 1 and 100.
Receive feedback on your guess and continue guessing until you find the correct number.
After guessing correctly, see the number of attempts taken and decide whether to play again.
If you choose to play again, a new number will be generated, and the game will restart.
If you choose not to play again, the game will end with a thank-you message.
Technologies Used:

Java Programming Language
Java Standard Library (Scanner for input, Random for generating the number to guess)
 TASK 2:ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME
 The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic hand game that has been brought to life through a simple yet engaging console-based Java application. This project provides a fun and interactive way for users to play against the computer in a series of rounds until either the player or the computer scores 5 points.

Features:

User-Friendly Interface:

The game starts with a welcoming interface that prompts the user to enter their name, adding a personalized touch to the gaming experience.
Game Mechanics:

The player can choose between three options: Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The computer randomly generates its choice.
The rules are simple: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both the player and the computer choose the same option, it's a tie with no points awarded.
Score Tracking:

The game keeps track of the scores for both the player and the computer. Scores are displayed after each round, allowing players to see their progress.
Winning and Losing:

The first to reach 5 points wins the game. Upon winning or losing, a message is displayed congratulating the winner or notifying the player of their defeat.
Replay Option:

After the game ends, the player is asked if they want to play again. This allows for continuous play without restarting the application.
Clean Exit:

If the player chooses not to continue, the game ends with a thank-you message, ensuring a clean and polite exit from the game.
Project Goals:

Enhance Programming Skills: This project aims to enhance Java programming skills, particularly in using loops, conditionals, and random number generation.
User Interaction: It focuses on improving user interaction and providing a smooth gaming experience through the console.
Basic Game Development: It serves as an introduction to basic game development concepts, including game loops, score tracking, and replayability.
How to Play:

Run the Java application.
Enter your name when prompted.
Follow the instructions to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering the corresponding number (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, 3 for Scissors).
View the results of each round and the current scores.
Continue playing until either you or the computer reaches 5 points.
Choose whether to play again after the game ends.
